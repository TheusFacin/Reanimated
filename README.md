# Reanimated

This is an app to test React Native Reanimated library.  
It contains three screens:

## Login

A page with an Image and Text animations when enter it

<div style="text-align: center"><img src="./.github/login.gif" height="250" alt="Login screen" /></div>

## Scroll

A page with a header that shrink when the list scrolls

<div style="text-align: center"><img src="./.github/scroll.gif" height="250" alt="Scroll screen" /></div>

## Drag

A page with a block that moves around and have two states:

- Green - it will not go back to original position
- Red - it will go back to original position

To toggle states, just double tap it

<div style="text-align: center"><img src="./.github/drag.gif" height="250" alt="Drag Screen" /></div>
